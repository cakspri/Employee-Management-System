# 12-EmployeeContentManagementSystem_using_mysql-node.js
A command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## Task

Developers frequently have to create interfaces (**content management systems (CMS)**) that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. This week's assignment is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## User Story

```md
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business
```

## SOLUTION:
 
üóÇÔ∏è [Github Repository](https://github.com/cakspri/Employee-Management-System)

üì∞[ReadMe](https://github.com/cakspri/Employee-Management-System/blob/main/README.md)

## Installation Instructions: 
To view the **content management systems (CMS)** interface, first run 'npm install' or 'npm i' after cloning this repository to your local system in order to install the npm package dependencies as specified in the 'package.json'. Prior to proceeding update the .envUpdateMe by editing your mysql username and password for the db & updating the file name to .env in the root folder itself. Next proceed to source the schema and seed files by connecting to the mysql db using your login credentials and then run this application using 'node server.js' or 'npm start' to plough through the subsequent command line prompts. 

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
‚úì WHEN I start the application THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role
‚úì WHEN I choose to view all departments THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids
‚úì WHEN I choose to view all roles THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
‚úì WHEN I choose to view all employees THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
‚úì WHEN I choose to add a department THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database
‚úì WHEN I choose to add a role THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database
‚úì WHEN I choose to update an employee role THEN I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database 
‚úì WHEN I choose to add an employee THEN I am prompted to enter the employee‚Äôs first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database
```
## Bonus Requirements

Try to add some additional functionality to your application, such as the ability to do the following:
```
‚úÖ Update employee managers
‚úÖ View employees by manager
    üëâSELECT * FROM employee WHERE manager_id IS NOT NULL;
‚úÖ View employees by department
    üëâSELECT * FROM employee JOIN department ON department.id = employee.role_id WHERE role_id IS NOT NULL;
‚úÖ Delete:roles
‚úÖ Delete:departments and employees
‚úÖ View the total utilized budget of a department;in other words, the combined salaries of all employees in that department
    üëâSELECT SUM(salary) AS "Total Salary" FROM employees;
```
